## Automated Tuning of Lumped Parameter Network (LPN) for Coronary Simulation
We can increase the accuracy of a 3D coronary simulation by adding a lumped parameter network (LPN) to specify the boundary conditions. The LPN are described through a set of ordinary differential equations that use a circuit element representation of the heart and distal circulation. The equations consist of several parameters (e.g., resistance, compliance, inductance, etc) that need to be tuned to match clinical targets of the patients, such as blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume and others. Manually tuning all of these parameters can be tedious.

We have developed an LPN parameter tuning framework that allows us to automatically tune these parameters to match the clinical targets of the patient. The pipeline requires runing a series of 3D simulations (rigid and FSI) until the parameters from the simulation match the clinical targets. The script ```CT_coronary_automated_tuning.py``` can perform the entire tuning pipeline, and has been tested on SciNet's Niagara cluster.
