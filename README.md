## Automated Tuning of Lumped Parameter Network (LPN) for Coronary Simulation
We can increase the accuracy of a 3D coronary simulation by adding a lumped parameter network (LPN) to specify the boundary conditions. The LPN are described through a set of ordinary differential equations that use a circuit element representation of the heart and distal circulation. The equations consist of several parameters (e.g., resistance, compliance, inductance, etc) that need be tuned to match clinical targets of the patients, such as blood pressure, heart rate, stroke volume and others.
